## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4), inspired by intelligence and the limitless bounds of language, provides a modern, clean, trustworthy feel. Avoids the clich√©s of greens and yellows for word games while retaining a sense of vibrancy.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very desaturated version of the primary hue, provides a gentle backdrop that doesn't distract from the game elements.
- Accent color: Violet (#9FA8DA), an analogous color to the primary blue, adding a touch of sophistication and contrast. This can be used for highlighting newly discovered words or the 'Word of the Day.'
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its clean and readable design, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, clear icons. These can include simple letter representations and a clock.
- Use a simple, spacious layout. Ensure the nine letters are easily accessible.
- Employ subtle animations on letter selection and word submission to provide clear user feedback without being distracting.
