Each suggestion needs a "Word of the Day" (WotD) and "Seeding Letters".

Constraints for each suggestion:
1.  **Word of the Day (wordOfTheDayText)**:
    *   Must be a common English word.
    *   Must be between 6 and 9 letters long (inclusive).
    *   Must contain only uppercase English letters.
2.  **Seeding Letters (seedingLetters)**:
    *   Must be a string of exactly 9 uppercase English letters.
    *   The Word of the Day *must* be formable using only the letters provided in Seeding Letters, respecting letter frequencies. For example, if WotD is "APPLE" and Seeding Letters is "APLEXYZQS", this is invalid because "APPLE" needs two 'P's but Seeding Letters only has one. If Seeding Letters is "APLEXPYZS", this is valid.
    *   The seeding letters should ideally contain the WotD letters plus some distractor letters to make the puzzle challenging but fair.

Generate exactly {{quantity}} such suggestions. Ensure each generated WotD is indeed formable from its corresponding Seeding Letters.
Return the output in the specified JSON format.
Example of one suggestion:
{
  "wordOfTheDayText": "EXAMPLE",
  "seedingLetters": "AXEMLPEXR"
}
(Note: "EXAMPLE" can be formed from "AXEMLPEXR")
`,
});
